# Welcome to TRU RAG Pipeline! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

This is a advanced Retrieval Augment Pipeline using two open source LLMs 
"mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1" (8x7B sparse mixture of experts models (SMoE)) and "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1" (7B parameter model) for text generation.

It uses "BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5" for Vector Embeddings and 'BAAI/bge-reranker-large' for finetuned re-ranking. 

Vector database is Chroma.

All documents ingested in the pipeline are available in the folder PDFs
